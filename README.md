# GODRenamer
Simple python script to rename Xbox360 GOD folders to either their TitleID or retail name using a CSV with the stored information. Drop these both wherever your gods are and run frwp.py
It'll prompt you to choose which direction you're going

Credit to IronRingX for their csv. Made my life easier :P https://github.com/IronRingX/xbox360-gamelist/blob/main/xbox360_gamelist.csv
